## Sites Not Covered
 * IAmTimCorey main site (https://www.iamtimcorey.com) - this is being completely redone. Right now, it is hosted by Teachable and is rather restricted. We are replacing it with a new and improved site.
 * Courses site - the hosting for our paid courses is on Teachable. We do not have control over site outages, network slowdowns, or other issues related to that site. If you do encounter a problem with the site and cannot get help from Teachable, you can email help@iamtimcorey.com and we will do what we can.
